                            Dtechtive is a search engine that helps people find
                            datasets from websites that existing search engines
                            fail to index. This is possible because of the
                            intelligent and comprehensive dataset onboarding
                            process adopted by Dtechtive. Since the onboarding
                            process is continuous, people will get access to the
                            latest versions of the published datasets. The
                            search results are not just keyword matches but also
                            contextual (semantic matching), helping people
                            discover a wider set of datasets using simple search
                            terms. Dtechtive also provides insights on dataset
                            quality and usage, helping people select the most
                            relevant datasets for their use cases. Most
                            importantly, Dtechtive allows Data Users to give
                            feedback to Data Providers, helping them improve
                            dataset quality.

                            Dtechtive onboards datasets (metadata only) from
                            open and commercial Data Providers onto the search
                            engine at no cost. This makes the datasets more
                            discoverable to people, helping generate interest in
                            the organisation and its datasets. For commercial
                            data providers, this may act as a sales funnel to
                            generate leads. Further, Dtechtive delivers insights
                            on dataset quality (metadata and data file), helping
                            Data Providers take action to improve downstream
                            (data processing, analysis, visualisation, et al.)
                            efficiencies for Data Users. Dtechtive also delivers
                            insights on dataset usage (search terms used,
                            download metrics, use cases, et al.), helping Data
                            Providers understand the Data User needs better.
                            Using Dtechtive, all of these insights can be
                            transferred into editable reports to help Data
                            Providers easily create business cases. ðŸ’¡ If you
